hi
you can use the scripts by putting "loadstring(game:HttpGet("SCRIPT-LINK"))()" in your executor and replacing "SCRIPT-LINK" with the link (has to be raw) of a script.
as an example: for Money Simulator Z i'd use "loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxyboy444/xc/refs/heads/main/Money%20Simulator%20Z"))()"
